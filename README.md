# vulunerable-micro-kernel
- just creating a basic microkernel
- mainly to understand exploit development from the ground up
- analyzing patterns in stable kernels wouldâ€™ve been better, but i m studying OS this semester so...
- keeping it simple first, can always expand into a more complex kernel later
