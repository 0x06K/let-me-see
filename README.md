## Under Construction
- just creating a basic microkernel  
- mainly to understand exploit development from the ground up  
- analyzing patterns in stable kernels wouldâ€™ve been better, but studying OS this semester so...  
- intentionally making it vulnerable to observe how vulnerabilities appear in a kernel, though it might not fully reflect real-world scenarios
